# Ghost-Website-Template
This is a website template for your open-source or software project that you can change to your liking. Simply fork it.

## Important note
The Font Awesome icons will only work on my website, so you will add your own Font Awesome script tag. To create a kit go to https://fontawesome.com
## Making adjustments
If you have changed code in the src/ folder, you'll have to run `npm run build`. This will recompile the JavaScript files to use JSX.
